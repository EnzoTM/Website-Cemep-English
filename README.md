On this page will have a lot of information about how to do the application and how to know who it’s going to get in.

There will be three types of login: 

Student
After a student login they will be able to see the “Student area”, where will be all the current subjects that the student have, the name of the student, the year and class, and an option to change the password. Selecting a subject the student will be taken to a page where the student will have to choose between the available bimesters. Choosing one of them will be shown the student grade on that exactly bimester and that exactly subject. 
 After the teacher of subject X closes a bimester X, the student can see if he or she got on recovery or not. A student will go to the recovery if his or her grade at the end of the bimester is lower than 6. If the student is on recovery, he or she will do a recovery test, and if the grade on this test is 6 or higher it will be showing that he or she do recovered and the student grade on the report card will be changed to 6.
After all the teachers have already closed the bimester, the student now can access the report card, where they can see all the grades in each subject, and in each bimester that are closed. 

Teacher
When someone log in as a teacher, there will be the “Teacher’s area”, where will be showed the name of the teacher, the subject given by the teacher, an option to change the password, all the years that this teacher has classes and for all the years showed will be the bimesters available. Choosing the bimester and the year now the teacher can assign the grades to the students.
Doesn’t matter the subject and the year, for all of them will have the default test called “Integrativa”, where the maximum value is 4, besides the integrativa, the teacher can edit that bimester by adding news tests and their maximum value. 
After assigning the grades (or while assigning), the teacher can save by clicking in “Save”, every time a grade is higher than the maximum of the test, there will be showing an alert to the teacher that some grade exceeded the limit (the same will apply to the recovery test).     
When a teacher had already chosen the entire test that will be given, and had already assigned the grade to the students, they can finally close the bimester. When the bimester is closed, the save, edit, close, buttons won’t be showed, and the teacher can’t change the grades of the students anymore. It will show now all the student’s grade (the ones in recovery will have their grade in red), some information about the class, such as the percentage of the numbers of the students in recovery, the average grade of the hole class, and the average grade of the class, but just the ones that aren’t in recovery. Beyond of this, there will be a button called “Recovery”, where will be all the students in recovery.
At the recovery button, there will be just one test with the maximum value of 10, and again, the teacher can assign the grades, save it and close it, after closing, all the students that got a 6 or higher grade on the recovery test will now have their grade at the report card of this subject and bimester changed to the 6.
